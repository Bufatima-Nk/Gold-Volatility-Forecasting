# Gold Price Volatility Forecasting with GARCH Model

## Introduction
This project focuses on forecasting gold price volatility using a GARCH (Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity) model. The goal is to provide insights into the volatility of gold prices, which can be valuable for investors and analysts in the financial sector.

## Project Overview
- Import and collect historical gold price data.
- Prepare and clean the data for analysis.
- Perform exploratory data analysis to understand the trends and patterns in gold prices.
- Conduct time series analysis to determine the lag for the GARCH model.
- Build, evaluate, and train a GARCH(1,1) model for forecasting gold price volatility.
- Perform walk forward validation to assess the model's performance on rolling data.
- Communicate the results through visualizations and a JSON output of volatility forecasts.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, you will need a Python environment with the required libraries. Additionally, access to the internet is required to collect historical gold price data using the `yfinance` library.

## Data Collection
The project uses the `yfinance` library to collect historical gold price data. The data is retrieved from Yahoo Finance and stored in a CSV file for further analysis.

## Data Preparation
Data preparation involves cleaning the dataset by dropping unnecessary columns, converting the date column to datetime format, and resampling the data to daily frequency (D). The dataset is sorted by date.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
Descriptive statistics are calculated, and a time series plot of gold prices is created. Daily returns and volatility are calculated and visualized. ACF and PACF plots are used to determine the lag for the GARCH model.

## Time Series Analysis
Time series analysis includes creating a time series plot of gold returns and calculating rolling volatility with a 50-day window.

## Model Building
A GARCH(1,1) model is built using the `arch` library and trained on the gold return data.

## Model Evaluation
The model is evaluated using summary statistics, AIC, BIC, and residual analysis to assess its fit to the data.

## Model Forecasting
The trained GARCH model is used to generate one-day ahead volatility forecasts. These forecasts are converted to JSON format for future use.

## Walk Forward Validation
Walk forward validation is performed to assess the model's performance on a rolling basis. Volatility predictions are compared to actual returns.

## Results Communication
A `clean_prediction` function is provided to reformat model predictions into JSON format. This facilitates the communication of model results.

This project offers valuable insights into forecasting gold price volatility, making it a useful tool for investors and analysts in the financial sector.
